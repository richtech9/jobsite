The following table could be filled by triggers, and used both for the reddots and the cron job for automatic action
There is a flag  to show that reddot notices were displayed, so don't need to be displayed again
There is a flag to show that the auto action has been done

The table can be pruned automatically to keep it from growing larger than needed, once the data has been used up
