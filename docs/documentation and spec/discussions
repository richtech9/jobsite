Chat Window refrsh timer:
// so if there is a new room found in a previous call, reduce the timer, else do a longer timer ?
//yes, exactly. double the timer if no room is found. 
// the max is: 5min or maybe 10 min
//ok!
// go ahead! let's try this simple thing. 
// not sure. then, this duration needs to be saved in local session?
// it cannot be saved in db obviously, because there're many guest users, or other users. 
// I think in a local js var will work fine. It can be per page?
// so it will start new for each page.. but if you want it to remember after a page load, then yet it needs to be saved in a session var, and I can load it into the global js var for chat

// no. just a local js var. it's per page. itt's ok that 
//no need to remember it. it can be started any time. then it'll auto increase or decrease.

		(Note: need to check which tag is stored in this table, most likely, the most used tags)

		This content has multiple tags, for each tag id, get the content/freelancers that has the same tag id in wp_tags_cache_job table. Then display them. 


 In a freelancer's profile page, display related freelancers and content:
		This freelancer has multiple tags, for each tag id, get the content/freelancers that has the same tag id in wp_tags_cache_job table. Then display them. 




/////////////////// meaning of variables in the cron jobs
$haveTagData is if the tags_cache has that column set, for that tag. In the cron script for content, this means the column is content_ids

$haveTagData2  is if any tags_cache is set for that tag 

skipping when the column in tags_cache does not have the content_id for the tag,  but the row is set for the tag

The solution is to set the id of the tags_cache here, as by then the content id will be added to the column  

debugging home page interest tags
php tag: found 2

book tag id 24, missing from tags cache table
