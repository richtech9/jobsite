* jobs_worked_completed :
The count of when freelancer completes at least one milestone released in a job he was hired at
If a freelancer gets more than one milestone on a project, it does not change the jobs_worked_completed.
Likewise, if the project goes to mediation, or is reported, it also does not affect the number

Implemented by triggers (create,update) on wp_fl_milestone listening for status === 'completed'
when it gets here, see if wp_fl_post_user_lookup has a flag for this user and post for completion,
 if not then increment column count for linguist_id and add the flag for this post and user
 the value of this flag is also defined at PostLookupDataHelpers::POST_USER_DATA_FLAG_COMPLETE_JOB (value=4)
