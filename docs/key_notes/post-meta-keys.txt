KEYS TO ADD TO wp_posts table
post_title (first 40 characters), but need to set mysql ini to accept zero date



other post info:

post_status
post_type
author



cannot be searched with %like (incomplete)
post_title
post_author

more effecient usages

post data that is 1:1 , that is one data for the post has one value goes into a lookup table

post data that is 1:n where n is not known, has to go into other tables

    _bid_placed_by ! values cannot be %liked
        Is is currently a php serialized array. It can have zero, one or many user ids
    _bid_placed_by_<user_id #>
        Each bidder has a new meta key made here. There can be zero, one or many meta keys that start with this

    the wp_comments are where bids are stored. If the wp_comments were only for bids, and nothing else, we could use this table instead
    However, this is also where all the other post comments are stored for the entire WP, and to find the bid type is expensive
        BUT, could place a three character index on the comment_type , and use that in a compound index  (comment_post_ID,comment_type(3))
        On the other hand, this is a large table to keep in memory
    ALTERNATELY, can create a smaller table, to just store the post_id, and user_id , for bids.
                  Can add a integer flag here to store other user post associations
        BUT , extra table means more code changes, and adds complexity
        HOWEVER needed for all_contest_paricipants also, so need this table, with the flag to distinguish

        todo wp_post_user_lookup table:
            post_id bigint
            user_id bigint
            (int)lookup_flag,(int)lookup_val
