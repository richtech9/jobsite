Db chat logging table created, as well as js lib for xml

Need a way to convert the json, and object states, coming from the server chat rooms to be
in xml so can use one format in the logs

Made table to store logs

Next

  1) need to make ajax, that only is used when we want it to run, to
     store log content

 2) make stand along function (away from the chat library) to use this
    ajax when xml or dom or json or strings are added

 3) add in passive hoooks that do not change running code to record what
    is happening, by using the js function created in the last step. A
    lot of times this logging is already taking place, but is put in the
    console. I can capture the ajax and bosh coming in and out by
    modifying the code that exists for the form keys, and in a few
    places I will add in single line calls to this logging function when
    things happen in the library

  4) make url, accessable to admin only, that take a user id, or chat user
    id or chat room id, and returns the xml to show in the page as it was
    recieved in the logs. This will allow the tracing we need

Added logging to the chat js library/ started url to see them

In the middle of making the url to filter and see data, about halfway
done with that

Included small js library to make the json easier to read
