        <div class="col-md-12">Communicating with an entirely new global audience in their native language will undoubtedly yield excellent results. You gain the faith of your customer and create awareness of your brand, service, or product. In the grand scheme of things, a multilingual website is probably one of the most economical ways to market your company, capture new customers, build lasting relationships, and give your brand an international outlook.</div>

        <div class="col-md-12">Customers prefer personalization, and if they presume that you care and will attend to their preferences, they are more likely to do business with you. Think twice if you are tempted to expand your business with a single language website. Multiple studies have demonstrated that multi-lingual websites are far more effective in reaching new customers. An analysis by European Commission concluded that 9 in 10 internet users in the EU, when given a choice of languages, will use a site written in their native language. Expand your reach in all seven European regions and open up more doors for your business. Non-English speaking users are actively looking for the perfect solution for their problem. Multi-lingual websites show that you put the customer first.</div>

        <div class="col-md-12">To find a competitive advantage in today’s market, you need to think outside the box. Many organizations try to differentiate themselves from their competitors. Look at your competitors: if they have multilingual websites, then you need one simply to keep relevant. If they don’t, then you have a golden opportunity to lead the marketplace and build your company or brand abroad before anyone else. A multilingual website overcomes potential cultural barriers by granting access in a local language. This automatically places the user in a ‘cultural comfort zone’ because they are able to navigate, understand, and interact with the website.</div>
