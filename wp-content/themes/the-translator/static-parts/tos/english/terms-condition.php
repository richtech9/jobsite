    <p><strong>1.0      INTRODUCTION:</strong></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Welcome to PeerOK.com and wenren8.com. Please review the following terms carefully. The terms “us” or “we” or “our” refers to <strong>Coneld LLC, d/b/a PeerOK, PeerOK.com, and wenren8.com</strong>, which has an Internet website address of <a href="http://peerok.com">peerok.com</a> or www.wenren8.com.  These terms are interchangeable and should be understood to be one entity, sometimes generically referred to herein as “PeerOK.” PeerOK is the owner of this Website and the proprietor of any apps that may be offered or provided for mobile devices or other platforms.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">We provide a service that allows persons and businesses, called <strong>Clients</strong>, to match up with freelance language experts called <strong>Freelancers</strong>, who are adept in one or more freelance services, such as translating, editing, proofreading, or writing. The Client may use the website to sign a purchase agreement to buy any of these language services from a chosen Freelancer. The site contains postings from Freelancers, who are qualified freelance translators, editors, proofreaders and writers in a variety of different languages. The Freelancers generally may be able to perform a variety of professional tasks. At any time, a Client needing language services can come onto our site, post a message for services wanted, and surf through the listings to see if the right Freelancer is there for the job. Due to the volume of Freelancers who are listed on the site, it is usually possible for a Client to obtain language services pertaining to any of the world’s most popular languages, and for some languages not so well known.</p>
    <p>We do not get involved in controlling the performance of the actual contract between Freelancer and Client. We are instead a clearing center and a facilitator. We provide a secure environment for people with mutually complementary needs to come together and do business. You may generally analogize PeerOK to the classified section of your local newspaper, except that we process the administrative and monetary functions of the transactions on behalf of the parties; we remain active in processing the transaction from the initial ad all the way up to the final payment and amicable closing of the matter.</p>
    <p>Further details are contained in these <strong>Terms and Conditions</strong> and in the administrative provisions, general provisions, privacy policy, other policy statements, and any other materials provided hereunder, which are incorporated into and recognized as a part of these terms and conditions and a part of the legal contract that you accept when you use our site.</p>

The term “User” may at times herein be used as a generic collective identifier that refers to either a Visitor, User or a Member. No legal meaning is to be inferred from the occasional interchangeable use of these terms. All text, information, graphics, design, and data offered through our Website or apps are collectively known as our “Content”. We distinguish content posted by our Members as “Member Content”.</p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">1.6 THE TERMINOLOGY IS GENERAL AND INCLUSIVE</p>
    <p>The use of the phrase “Terms and Conditions” in this and related documents is inclusive rather than exclusive. The phrase generally includes and is referring also to the Privacy Policy, Administrative Guidelines, and any separate policy statements or related materials that may be published herein or on the website or the App(s), if any, including any attachments, deletions, amendments, or modifications later added. Likewise, references to the Privacy Policy and other policy components are inclusive rather than exclusive, in the same manner. In that sense, all provisions must be read together to arrive at their best inclusive meaning. When we say, for example, to check your ‘terms and conditions’, we are directing you to check out all published provisions in this Agreement, and all other relevant material whether contained here or appearing on the website or the App.<br />
        Furthermore, the terms “terms and conditions”, “terms of use”, “terms of use and service”, and any similar references in this Agreement are intended to be used interchangeably and generically, so that there are no distinguishing legal characteristics that separate one of them from the others. We may from time to time issue an App for Members to download and use on their devices to conveniently access the services. These Terms and Conditions, along with all related material herein, apply with equal force and effect to any Apps or software programs that we may in the future provide on this platform or any other platforms or media, and these terms and conditions shall be read consistently with any terms and conditions that may be included with any app(s).</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">1.7 HEADINGS</p>
    <p>The headings in these Terms &amp; Conditions are a matter of convenience only, and no legal import should be attributed to the wording or placement of the headings.</p>

The Member represents and warrants that such information is accurate, and agrees to pay to PeerOK any additional charges arising from any inaccuracy in such information within seven days of notification.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">4.0 REGISTRATION AND MEMBERSHIP:</p>
    <p>To register and become a Member you must be at least 18 years of age to enter and form a legally binding contract. Anyone who uses false information to certify being 18 or older will lose all privileges immediately when discovered by PeerOK and may forfeit any job agreements, sums held in escrow or pending payments of any kind. You will not be accepted as a Member if you were previously barred from the site or from the site of an associate of PeerOK. A Member must qualify under the laws and statutes of the United States or an applicable jurisdiction. When you register, PeerOK may collect information such as your name, e-mail address, birth date, gender, mailing address, occupation, industry and personal interests. You hereby acknowledge that you have voluntarily, knowingly and willingly provided this information as a prerequisite to becoming a Member. You can edit your account information at any time.

    <p style="text-align: justify;">4.1 TRUE AND CORRECT INFORMATION:</p>
    <p>The registering party hereby acknowledges, understands and agrees to:<br />
        a) furnish factual, correct, current and complete information with regards to yourself as may be requested by the data registration process, and<br />
        b) maintain and promptly update your registration and profile information to maintain accuracy and completeness always.<br />

    <p style="text-align: justify;">4.2 UNDER 18 REQUIRES FAMILY ACCOUNT:</p>
    <p>PeerOK.com has a priority of assuring the safety and privacy of all its visitors, users and members, especially that of children. Children may not legally contract to purchase or sell services or products under the law of all jurisdictions. Persons under the age of 18 are not allowed to create an account and become a Member of PeerOK, as stated above.<br />
        However, we do provide the option of allowing the parents or legal guardian of any child under the age of 18 that wish to permit their child or children access to the PeerOK website under their full supervision, to create a "family" account, which will certify that the individual creating the "family" account is of 18 years of age and as such, the parent or legal guardian of any child or children registered under the "family" account. As the creator of the "family" account, he is thereby granting permission for his/her child or children to access the various Services provided, including, but not limited to, message boards, email, and/or instant messaging. It is the parent's and/or legal guardian's responsibility to determine whether any of the Services and/or content provided are age-appropriate for his/her child.<br />
        If the child is a student desiring to purchase freelance services for academic purposes, the child may only do so through the auspices, permission, supervision and control of the parent or legal guardian. The adult must create an account with an acceptable service such as PayPal, or other account acceptable to PeerOK, and must be the signatory and party legally responsible as the contracting party to the agreement. The adult must agree to approve and ratify all activities of the child. Any violation of this requirement may result in cessation of all services including the cessation of pending agreements and the possible forfeiture of part or all of escrow funds in the case of the Member’s fraud or misrepresentation or where there are debits against the account.<br />
        This procedure is designed to be fully compliant with federal mandates embodied in the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), which provides children and their parents or guardians with meaningful protection of their privacy rights. We intend to maintain this as a sight where parental peace of mind is assured while children are at the same time given a safe and secure facility to learn and progress in their academic pursuits that may include freelance services.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">4.3 MEMBER ACCOUNT, USERNAME, PASSWORD AND SECURITY</p>
    <p>When you set up an account, you are the sole authorized user of your account. You shall be responsible for maintaining the secrecy and confidentiality of your password and for all activities that transpire on or within your account. It is your responsibility for any act or omission of any user(s) that access your account information through your own action or omission. It shall be your responsibility to notify PeerOK.com immediately if you notice any unauthorized access or use of your account or password or any other breach of security. PeerOK.com shall not be held liable for any loss and/or damage arising from any failure to comply with these terms and conditions. You further agree not to use any username, or password of another User of the Site that you are not authorized to use, and not to allow others who are not authorized to do so to use your Account at any time.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">4.4 PeerOK NOT LIABLE FOR ADVERTISERS</p>
    <p>Any correspondence or business dealings with, or the participation in any promotions of, advertisers located on or through our Services, which may include the payment and/or delivery of such related goods and/or Services, and any such other term, condition, warranty and/or representation associated with such dealings, are and shall be solely between you and any such advertiser. Moreover, you herein agree that PeerOK.com shall not be held responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any nature or manner incurred as a direct result of any such dealings or because of the presence of such advertisers on our website.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">4.5 PeerOK NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR LINKS</p>
    <p>Either PeerOK.com or any third parties may provide links to other websites and/or resources. Thus, you acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for the availability of any such external sites or resources, and as such, we do not endorse nor are we responsible or liable for any content, products, advertising or any other materials, on or available from such third-party sites or resources. Furthermore, you acknowledge and agree that PeerOK.com shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any such damage or loss which may be a result of, caused or allegedly to be caused by or about the use of or the reliance on any such content, goods or Services made available on or through any such site or resource.

    <p style="text-align: justify;">5.0 PROCEDURES FOR ORDERS, SERVICES AND PAYMENT</p>
    <p>The following sets forth the policies and procedures for orders, agreements, services, administrative procedures, payment, disputes, cancellation, and other related issues.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">5.1 CLIENT PROCEDURES</p>

    <p>The within rules and procedures govern the financial relationship between PeerOK and its Members.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">5.21 THE PAYMENT SERVICE</p>
    <p>The PeerOK Billing and Payment Service ("Payment Service") enables Freelancers to make a Submission and enables Client’s to make payments for Freelance Services. When you use the Payment Service, PeerOK facilitates your desired actions but is not an agent or employee of any Member. As the neutral entity that provides a platform and facilitates certain services, PeerOK is independent from the details of the transactions and the claims that could potentially arise between Clients and Freelancers.<br />
        Before initiating an Order, you must buy sufficient PeerOK credits for the Services you desire to purchase. PeerOK credits are non-refundable and can be purchased at PeerOK.com.<br />
        PeerOK will apply gross-up calculation to the payment. This means that the payment to PeerOK of its service fees must be made in cleared funds, without any deduction or set-off and free and clear of and without deduction for or because any taxes, levies, imports, duties, charges, fees and withholdings of any nature now or hereafter imposed by any governmental, fiscal or other authority save as required by law. If you are compelled to make any such deduction, you will pay PeerOK any additional amounts as are necessary to ensure receipt by PeerOK of the full amount it would have received but for the deduction.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">5.22 YOUR FUNDS IN YOUR ACCOUNT</p>
    <p>PeerOK IS NOT A BANK, AND AMOUNTS TRANSFERRED THROUGH OR STORED IN THE PAYMENT SERVICE ARE NOT INSURED DEPOSITS. You will not receive interest or other earnings on the funds in your Account. PeerOK may earn and retain interest on those funds, or may receive a reduction in fees or expenses charged for banking services or other compensation in respect of any balances in Accounts. By adding funds to your Account, at the appropriate time you will be able to designate the amount of the funds to be sent and the recipient of the funds. PeerOK agrees to transfer the funds to the designated account to facilitate a smooth transfer but once again, PeerOK is a facilitator of its platform, and is not involved as an agent or employee in the handling of funds belonging to any members, but rather acts at all time in an independent capacity.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">5.23 THE MECHANICS OF PAYMENTS AND OTHER PROCEDURES</p>
    <p>The prices posted for the amount and type of Services a Client can purchase, including bundled packages, are displayed on the Site and subject to change at PeerOK's discretion. Any change in these prices shall apply on a going-forward basis. The following considerations apply:<br />
        1. Authorized Payments are Final -- Your use of the Payment Service constitutes your agreement to pay for any amounts that you authorize us to charge against your Account and, as appropriate, your credit card, bank account, PayPal, or Alipay. Such payments, once authorized, are final.<br />
        2. Erroneous or Duplicate Transactions; Charge Backs -- PeerOK reserves the right to seek reimbursement from you, and you hereby agree to reimburse PeerOK, in the event of erroneous, duplicate or mistaken transactions. This applies if PeerOK discovers erroneous or duplicate transactions, or PeerOK receives a charge back from the Member’s credit card company, bank, PayPal, or Alipay for any reason. You agree that PeerOK has the right to obtain such reimbursement by charging your Account, deducting amounts from future payments or withdrawals, charging your credit card, or obtaining reimbursement from you by any other lawful means. Failure to pay for reimbursements of charge backs is cause for termination of your Account.<br />
        3. Currency -- The Payment Service operates in U.S. Dollars and therefore PeerOK is not responsible for currency fluctuations that occur when billing or crediting a credit or debit card denominated in a currency other than U.S. Dollars, nor is PeerOK responsible for currency fluctuations that occur when receiving or sending payment via wire transfer, check or automated clearinghouse to and from your Account. Payments made to PeerOK in currency other than U.S. Dollars may take up to eight weeks to process, depending on relationships among the banking and payment systems between the two countries. Consequently, balance adjustments may be delayed. You are encouraged to do your transactions with the Payment in U.S. Dollars only when possible.<br />
        4. The Payment Service will transfer the funds to the Freelancer’s account. PeerOK will submit a U.S. Dollar payment via PayPal or Alipay equal to the withdrawal amount. This payment will be made to the user's PayPal or Alipay Account. The PayPal or Alipay Account may be changed at any time in the user's Account. Payment will not be made unless Freelancer has uploaded a signed W-9 or W-8BEN form.<br />
        6. Where there is no PayPal or Alipay account. In that event, PeerOK will notify the Member by email to the Member’s email address notifying him or her of the payment. The Member will receive instructions to set up a free PayPal account to access the funds. It would be prudent for Members to have a PayPal or other acceptable account set up prior to using the service.<br />
        7. Hold on Account Funds -- PeerOK reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to place a hold on funds for Client payments to clear, or if PeerOK suspects monies may be subject to dispute or charge back or if fraud is suspected. PeerOK will release a hold as soon as practical and reasonable in its discretion.<br />
        8. Freelancers Shall Use PeerOK for All Payments. You acknowledge that PeerOK earns its fees through transactions that take place on the Site. You agree not to take any action directly or indirectly to circumvent these fees. You also agree to notify PeerOK immediately if a Client seeks to pay you outside the Site. Members agree that such attempts to circumvent payment to PeerOK of its service fees is a prohibited activity and will subject the violator to termination and penalties.<br />
        9. Inactive and Abandoned Accounts. If your Account has a balance, but has had no activity for at least six (6) consecutive months, your Account will be placed on "Inactive" status. PeerOK will notify you that your Account is Inactive by sending an email to your registered email address, giving you the option of keeping your Account open and maintaining the balance or withdrawing the balance. If, within thirty (30) days of such notice, your account has no activity, and you have not responded, PeerOK will automatically deduct an Inactive Account Fee of $9, or the entire balance of your Account if such balance is less than $9, per month thereafter, to recover administrative costs of holding funds. PeerOK will cease such deductions if subsequently your Account has activity. Otherwise, PeerOK will terminate your account if subsequently your Account no longer has a balance.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">5.24 CONTROL OF FRAUD AND OTHER PROBLEMS:</p>
    <p>Notwithstanding any other provision of these Terms and Conditions, if PeerOK determines in its sole discretion that a Client or Freelancer has violated the conditions and restrictions of the Site or Terms of Service, or the required procedures regarding the Payment Service, PeerOK has the right to refuse to process the transaction, and it may terminate the respective accounts of any Members who are violators. Whenever termination or an account closing is brought about by wrongdoing of a Member or Members, PeerOK has the discretion to withhold as additional service fees and/or penalties any amount that it deems just and reasonable under the circumstances. We reserve the right to suspend a User withdrawal request if the source of the funds is suspected to be fraudulent.<br />
        If we become aware that any funds received into an Account from another Account because of a fraudulent transaction (e.g. refilled credits using a stolen credit card) it will be reversed immediately. If those funds have already been released to you, you must pay the funds into your Account. If you do not do so, we may suspend, limit or cancel your account, or act against you to recover those funds.<br />
        We may, in our sole discretion, place a limit on any or all the funds in your Account (thereby preventing any use of the funds) if:<br />
        a) we believe there may be a high level of risk associated with you, your Account, or any or all your transactions, including if we believe that there is a risk that such funds will be subject to reversal or chargeback;<br />
        b) we believe that the beneficiary of the payment is someone other than you;<br />
        c) we believe that the payment is being made to a country where we do not offer our Service; or<br />
        d) we are required to do so by law.<br />
        e) If you are involved in a dispute, we may (in certain circumstances) place a temporary limit on the funds in your Account to cover the amount of any potential liability. If the dispute is resolved in your favor, we will lift the limit on your funds and those funds may be released to you. If the dispute is not resolved in your favor, we may remove the funds from your Account.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">5.25 POLICY ON REFUNDS</p>
    <p>Client may cancel a job and claim a refund before the selected Freelancer has started working on it. The refund will be deposited into Client’s account as non-refundable credits. Once the work has been started by the Freelancer, no refunds will be issued.<br />
        We may refund funds to Members regardless of whether a Member has requested funds be refunded if:<br />
        1. we are required by law or consider that we are required by law to do so;<br />
        2. we determine that refunding funds to the User will avoid any dispute or an increase in our costs;<br />
        3. we refund funds to the User in accordance with any refund policy specified by us from time to time;<br />
        4. we find out that the original payment made by the User is fraudulent;<br />
        5. the User made a duplicate payment in error; or<br />
        6. we consider, in our sole determination, that it is likely that the refund of funds is necessary to avoid a credit card chargeback.<br />
        You can request a refund by using our Client support website or emailing us at refund@PeerOK.com. If you have done so, you must not initiate a chargeback request with your credit card issuer until all reasonable efforts have been exhausted to resolve your request.<br />
        If you have already initiated a chargeback request with your credit card issuer, you must not request a refund of funds by contacting us and you must not seek double recovery, upon penalty of law. If we reasonably determine, having considered all the relevant circumstances, that you have made an excessive or unreasonable number of requests to refund funds back to you or chargebacks, we may suspend, limit or close your Account.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">5.26 YOU AGREE TO BE PAID BY PAYPAL OR ALIPAY</p>
    <p>You agree that any reward balance you accrue by working on PeerOK will be made via PayPal or Alipay in US dollars. We will not make wire transfers or use another method of payment. We will not process payments to you without a request from you. You affirm that you currently have a functioning PayPal or Alipay account to receive funds from PeerOK. We pay Freelancers on the 11th and 25th of each month (“Payment Dates”) if we receive a payment request before the cut-off time. The cut-off time for the 11th is 5:00pm UTC-12 on the 5th of that month. The cut-off time for the 25th is 5:00pm UTC-12 on the 20th of that month. In some cases, unavoidable payment delays due to disruptions to PayPal’s or Alipay’s services occur, for which PeerOK cannot be held responsible.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">5.27 AGREEMENT TO PAY</p>
    <p>If, for any reason, PeerOK does not receive payment for any amounts that you have authorized to be paid through your use of the Payment Service or other PeerOK services, you agree to pay such amount immediately upon demand by PeerOK. You also agree to pay any interest charges, attorneys' fees and other costs of collection incurred by PeerOK in collecting past due funds. In such case, PeerOK may, at its option, stop processing any further payments made by you and apply any amounts then held by PeerOK on your behalf toward any deficiencies, losses or costs that we have incurred from your use of the Payment Service or other PeerOK services. We may also make appropriate reports to credit reporting agencies, financial institutions, tax agencies and law enforcement authorities, and cooperate with them in any resulting investigation or prosecution.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">5.28 ALL PAYMENTS MUST BE MADE EXCLUSIVELY THROUGH THE PLATFORM:</p>
    <p>Client agrees to use PeerOK to make all payments to the Freelancer that you have contracted with for a job. The Client hereby acknowledges that PeerOK earns its fees through transactions that take place on the Site. The Client agrees not to take any action directly or indirectly to circumvent these fees. If a Freelancer solicits payment from you outside the Site, you agree to notify PeerOK immediately.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">5.29 YOU WILL SIGN U.S.A. TAX AND REGULATORY DOCUMENTATION</p>
    <p>Payments will be made from Coneld LLC, our U.S. parent company. Currently, under U.S. federal tax law, PeerOK is required to request certain taxpayer information from Freelancers who receive funds from PeerOK (whether such persons are U.S. taxpayers or not). We may request additional information from you in the future if required under U.S. law. All information collected will be used solely to fulfill the company’s requirements under U.S. law and will not be used for any other purpose.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">5.30 CLIENT MUST PROVIDE INSTRUCTIONS AND MATERIALS:</p>
    <p>Client can initiate an Order by providing all the required information via the forms and directions on the Platform.<br />
        Client is responsible for providing the Client Materials for the services. This includes materials describing the context of the translation, editing, or writing, and all other information and documents that are necessary to the performance of the freelance services being ordered. PeerOK may make recommendations on which source materials and in what format to provide source materials, but ultimately the quality of the results will depend on the clarity, accuracy, and comprehensiveness of the Client’s source materials and instructions provided.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">5.4 WITHDRAWALS</p>
    <p>a) The first withdrawal of funds earned by a Freelancer will be delayed for fifteen days for security and fraud purposes. Subsequent withdrawals may be delayed for up to thirty days where our fraud prevention policies dictate that a delay is required. A withdrawal can be requested either when the account balance is above $200.00 or when it has been at least three months since the last withdrawal. We impose a minimum 100 USD withdrawal amount for funds earned or a minimum duration of three months between consecutive withdrawals. Each withdrawal is subject to a processing fee of either 3% of the withdrawal amount, or 3 dollars, whichever is greater. The withdrawal amount paid to the Freelancer will reflect the deduction and pre-payment to PeerOK of the processing fee.<br />
        b) PeerOK always has the right in its discretion to perform a verification procedure of the Freelancer’s identity and credentials for security purposes prior to allowing the Freelancer to withdraw funds. For details of the verification procedures please read the Freelancer Support page. In any event, you acknowledge and agree that we may seek to verify your identity or request additional information from you to authenticate the legitimacy of our transactions with you.<br />
        c) All purchases by clients made on credit card or other credit mechanisms are non-refundable.<br />
        d) PeerOK always has and retains the sole discretion to determine the validity and authorization for refunds or withdrawals.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">5.41 CHARGEBACKS<br />
        A chargeback occurs when a Client files a challenge to a payment directly with their credit card issuer. A reversal instruction is made by the payment product issuer or third parties (such as payment processors) and not by us. We are bound to follow their instructions.<br />
        You acknowledge and agree that we will be entitled to recover chargebacks and reversals that may be imposed on us by a payment product issuer or third parties (such as payment processors) on funds paid to you by Client through the Website.<br />
        You agree that we may reverse any such payments made to you, which are subject to chargeback or reversal instructions via your payment product issuer or third parties (such as payment processors).</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">5.5 CANCELATION OF AN ORDER</p>
    <p>The Client can cancel any Order if the project has not yet been started by a Freelancer. After work is started, the Order cannot be cancelled and there will be no refund of credits. Providing, however, that an Order can be cancelled if the Freelancer has stopped performing or has engaged in any acts that would constitute a breach of the agreement for services.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">5.6 JOB COMPLETION</p>
    <p>A job is completed in either of the following two situations:<br />
        1) The Client clicks the button to “Approve Job Completed”;<br />
        2) The Freelancer has submitted the delivered files or revised delivered files and the Client has not requested revisions or clicked the button to “Approve Job Completed” within 120 hours of the submission.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">5.61 DELIVERED WORKS</p>
    <p>The PeerOK site cannot guarantee that a Freelancer will engage on your Order. If the Order is engaged by a Freelancer, PeerOK will return the delivered Works provided by the Freelancer to Client. You may request the Freelancer to revise the delivered Works as many times as you wish. The expected delivery time provided in the order is solely for information purposes and does reflect a legal deadline for breach of the agreement by the Freelancer. You hereby acknowledge and agree that PeerOK cannot control the actions of the Freelancer and is not responsible for late submission of work. PeerOK will do whatever is reasonably feasible in trying to meet the expected delivery time, but it cannot assure or guarantee an exact delivery time. In case Client requests revisions, the delivery time will be delayed by a reasonable time under the circumstances. You recognize and agree that PeerOK is not liable for any loss or damage caused by a late delivery time caused by the actions or omissions of the Freelancer. In addition to the waivers and releases contained herein, you recognize and agree that PeerOK is not in any event liable for damages relating to lost profits, emotional distress, or other losses caused by a late delivery. Notifications will be delivered when the Delivered Works are ready for your review.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">5.62 APPROVAL OR REVISION REQUEST</p>
    <p>(1) Upon PeerOK’s notification of delivery of the ordered work product, Client will have 120 hours to review the delivered product. Client may approve the delivered work product via the Platform. If Client does not respond within the 120-hour review period, the delivered product will be deemed “Approved”.<br />
        (2) Alternatively, Client may request revisions of the delivered work product within the 120-hour review period if Client reasonably determines that improvements are necessary to meet the specifications of the Order. Client may request as many rounds of revisions as necessary, if the revision requests are made within the 120-hour review period after the delivery of revised delivered work product. If Client does not respond within the 120-hour review period, the revised Delivered Works will be deemed “Approved”.<br />
        (3) Client agrees to approve or request revision of each Order within 120 hours of the notice of delivery being sent to the Client. Failure to approve or request revision of an Order within 120 hours will irrevocably deem the content approved by the Client.<br />
        (4) Client agrees to document detailed reasons for requesting revisions of any Order submitted for approval, and Client agrees that unreasonable or frivolous requests will be denied at the sole and absolute discretion of PeerOK. Client agrees to accept the determination by PeerOK that the service Order has been satisfied and/or that the agreement has been concluded with payment to the Freelancer.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">5.63 DISPUTES OVER ORDERS</p>
    <p>(1) PeerOK resolves disputes at its discretion. Whether in the capacity of Client or Freelancer, you hereby recognize and agree that disputes must be quickly and decisively resolved so that the interests of both parties are served as effectively as possible. You also hereby agree to follow the standard dispute resolution procedures, which are defined in 5.63 in general. In addition to following the standard procedures, you may also hire an independent mediator by emailing any dispute to dispute@PeerOK.com. You also hereby agree that any dispute that is submitted and arises to PeerOK is subject to the sole discretion of PeerOK, and to abide by the determination of PeerOK. Each hiring of an independent mediator is subject to a dispute processing fee of 15 dollars that must be paid before the mediation is started.<br />
        (2) Always follow review procedures. Whether in the capacity of Client or Freelancer, you hereby recognize and agree to always follow the review and revision procedures as defined in Section 5.62 above and Section 22 in Conduct of Freelancers, even if there is an ongoing dispute, mediation, or arbitration on the order.<br />
        (3) Unsuccessful revision requests and Client requests rejection of order. If there is any dispute arising from orders not completed to the Client's satisfaction, after unsuccessful revision requests, the Client expressly agrees that he or she may request rejection of the order by hitting the “REQUEST REJECTION” button provided on the Job Details page of the order after the expected delivery date has passed and within 120 hours from the time the freelancer has submitted new or revised service files. The Client further expressly agrees that if he or she becomes satisfied with the service after requesting rejection, the Client shall approve the job completion and dismiss the rejection request. The Client further expressly agrees that after requesting rejection, he or she shall wait at least 20 days until the Freelancer decides whether to approve the rejection or hire an independent mediator to enter mediation.<br />
        (4) Freelancer’s response to request of rejecting order. The Freelancer expressly agrees that upon receiving notification of requesting rejection of an order from the Client, the Freelancer will choose one of the following two options provided on the Job Details page within 20 days of notification if Client does not approve job completion:<br />
        1. “Approve Rejection”; or<br />
        2. “Hire an independent mediator”<br />
        By choosing the first option, “Approve Rejection”, the order shall be cancelled, the advance payment shall be returned, the bid security deposit shall be fully refunded, and the Client shall be fully refunded. By choosing “Hiring an independent mediator”, the Freelancer hires an independent mediator from PeerOK  for a mediation fee of 15 USD to enter mediation. With mediation, the dispute shall be resolved at the sole discretion of PeerOK .<br />
        The Freelancer further expressly agrees that if he or she does not choose either of the two options while Client does not approve job completion within the 20 days of notification, it is considered dereliction of duty. In that case, PeerOK will automatically reject and cancel the order, and the company shall have the authority to declare a forfeiture of the Freelancer’s bidding security deposit.<br />
        (5) Independent mediation. Whether in the capacity of Client or Freelancer, you hereby recognize and agree that you will be notified of mediation by an independent mediator hired by either you or the other party for an agreeable solution. If you want to present any additional information other than those in the Job Details, you agree to email them to dispute@PeerOK.com within 5 business days upon notice of a mediation request.<br />
        Dispute resolution shall include review of original order specification, revision requests, and quality of work submitted by Freelancer. Resolutions may include, but are not limited to: affirming the quality and sufficiently met requirements of the Freelancer’s work, thereby deeming the project completed and payment to be duly paid to Freelancer; or canceling the order and restoring to the Client 's account balance the funds held for the Order. In cases of egregious malfeasance by the Freelancer, as to be determined at the discretion of PeerOK , the company shall have the authority to declare a forfeiture or partial forfeiture of Freelancer’s bidding deposit, and to take any other action authorized in these terms and conditions.<br />
        After reviewing all material, the mediator will try to make an acceptable non-binding resolution proposal. If both parties agree with the proposed, non-binding resolution proposal, they expressly agree that PeerOK  is authorized and irrevocably instructed to immediately execute the resolution proposal.<br />
        In the event that a case remains unresolved for more than 365 days, you recognize and agree that it is considered a late delivery, and the order will be cancelled with both parties fully refunded.<br />
        (6) Third-party arbitration. If you disagree with the proposed, non-binding resolution proposal, the mediator will ask if you want arbitration services and send you the quote of arbitration fees in the final mediation notice. If you or the other party do not choose to arbitrate within 5 business days after the final mediation notice, you agree that PeerOK  is authorized and irrevocably instructed to immediately reject the job.<br />
        If either you or the other party notifies PeerOK  via email of their intent to arbitrate, PeerOK  will notify you that you must pay the arbitration fee within 5 business days of the notice.<br />
        If neither you nor the other party pays the arbitration fee within 5 business days of the notice, then you will be deemed to have authorized and instructed PeerOK  to reject the job and dismiss the dispute.<br />
        If the Client pays the arbitration fee while the Freelancer does not pay the arbitration fee within 5 business days of the notice, then Client and Freelancer will be deemed to have irrevocably authorized and instructed PeerOK  to reject the job and dismiss the dispute. The arbitration fee will be fully refunded to Client.<br />
        If Freelancer pays the arbitration fee while Client does not pay the arbitration fee within 5 business days of the notice, then Client and Freelancer will be deemed to have irrevocably authorized and instructed PeerOK  to approve the completion of the job and dismiss the dispute. The arbitration fee will be fully refunded to the Freelancer.<br />
        If both Client and Freelancer pay the arbitration fee, PeerOK  will deliver instructions for initiating the arbitration. The job will be frozen and no more changes will be allowed.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">5.64 REJECTED CONTENT</p>
    <p>PeerOK will review any rejections by the Client and advise the Client if the rejection will be honored, on the following grounds:<br />
        a) If PeerOK determines that the content fails to deliver on the assignment requirements and terms of the original order, and<br />
        b) Client specifically describes why these specifications, requirements and/or terms have not been met, and<br />
        c) the Freelancer does not correct and/or improve the content per the original requirements and terms within 24 hours of request.<br />
        d) Failure of the Freelancer to make improvements to satisfaction within 24 hours of the submission of revision request will result in automatic final rejection. You agree that PeerOK has the discretion to make final decisions regarding acceptance of content revision submitted for approval.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">5.65 Various Important Disclaimers.</p>
    <p>In placing the order, the Client will designate material for instructions to prospective Freelancers. The Instruction File uploaded by the Client will be publicly visible to all registered Freelancers of PeerOK.com. The actual working files uploaded by Client will be only made visible to the Freelancer hired for the job. The Client is responsible for and assumes all risk of liability for determining what material to upload and which material to designate as instructions and as working files. PeerOK does not monitor or control the content of those materials and the site is not responsible for their contents. Client is also responsible and assumes all liability for the decision of hiring a Freelancer as an independent contractor and engaging him or her accordingly. Freelancer is responsible and assumes all liability for the decision of starting a job after receiving hiring notice by Client and being hired as an independent contractor and engaged for the job. All parties agree that PeerOK is not liable for the consequences of the Client’s decision to hire a Freelancer and/or the Freelancer’s decision to start a job and be hired. These Terms and Conditions do not in themselves create a partnership or agency relationship between Users or Members. A Freelancer does not have authority to enter written or oral (whether implied or express) contracts on behalf of PeerOK or to bind PeerOK to any terms and/or conditions with anyone. For Service Contracts entered on the PeerOK platform, Client may not require an exclusive relationship with a Freelancer. A Freelancer is an independent contractor who shall be free always to provide Freelance Services to persons or businesses other than Client on the PeerOK platform, including to any competitor of Client.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">5.7 PeerOK is a Third-Party Beneficiary to the Service Contract</p>
    <p>Members appoint PeerOK as a third-party beneficiary of their Service Contracts for the sole purposes of enforcing any obligations owed to, and any benefits conferred on, PeerOK hereunder. Members further agree that PeerOK has the right to take such actions with respect to their Accounts, including, without limitation, suspension, termination, or legal actions, as PeerOK, in its sole discretion, deems necessary to enforce its rights and to collect its fees as a third-party beneficiary under the Service Contracts.<br />
        These Terms and Conditions and Account registration will not be construed as creating or implying any relationship of agency, franchise, partnership, or joint venture between Users and PeerOK, except and solely as to the extent expressly stated in this Agreement.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">6 INTELLECTUALPROPERTY, COPYRIGHT AND TRADEMARK PROTECTION</p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">6.5 Counternotification To Claimed Copyright Infringement</p>
    <p>If a notice of copyright infringement has been filed with the website owner and/or the ISP against you, the owner and/or the ISP will attempt to notify you and provide you with a copy of the notice of copyright infringement.

        The website owner and/or the ISP will replace the removed material and cease disabling access to it in not less than 10, nor more than 14, business days following receipt of the counternotification, unless the website owner and/or ISP first receives notice from the complaining party that such complaining party has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain the alleged infringer from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on this website.<br />
        Please be advised that United States copyright law provides substantial penalties for a false counternotice filed in response to a notice of copyright infringement.

    <p style="text-align: justify;">8.92 PUBLICATION</p>
    <p>Without limiting the section on Confidentiality, Client, Freelancer, and PeerOK will not publish, or cause to be published, any other party’s Confidential Information or Work Product, except as may be necessary for performance of Freelance Services for a Services Contract.</p>

In the event of an audit of PeerOK, Freelancer agrees to promptly cooperate with PeerOK and provide copies of Freelancer’s tax returns and other documents as may be reasonably requested for purposes of such audit, including but not limited to records showing Freelancer is engaging in an independent business as represented to PeerOK.</p>

    <p>You may have funds in your Account if you have prepaid for fees or charges or for services to be provided to you via the Website. If you are a Freelancer, you may have funds if you have successfully completed a Project, or sold an item, and funds have been released to you. There are also circumstances where funds will have been credited to your Account in relation to an affiliate program or a referral program.</p>
    <p> Funds in your Account are held by us in our operating accounts held with reputable financial institutions. Funds in your Account are not held separately by us and may be commingled with our general operating funds and funds of other User's Accounts.</p>
    <p> You are not entitled to any interest, or other earnings for funds that are in your Account.</p>

Any such interest earned belongs to us and we will not be liable to any User for any imputed interest on such funds.</p>
    <p> If your Account has a negative amount of funds, we may:</p>
    <p> i. set-off the negative amount of funds with funds that you subsequently receive into your Account;</p>
    <p> ii. if you have funds in multiple currencies in your Account and one of the currencies becomes negative for any reason, we may set-off the negative amount against funds you maintain in a different currency balance (at an exchange rate applied by us);</p>
    <p> iii. reverse payments you have made from your Account to other User Accounts on the Website;</p>
    <p> iv. deduct amounts you owe us from money you subsequently add or receive into your Account; or</p>
    <p> v. immediately suspend or limit your Account until your Account no longer has a negative amount.</p>
    <p> vi. If we offset a negative amount of funds pursuant to this section, it may be bundled with another debit coming out of your Account.</p>

    <p> xv. we will hold funds in respect of the amount of your Account in an account held by us with a financial institution (or in any manner that we decide in our sole discretion from time to time) and such funds are not segregated into a separate account; and</p>
    <p> xvi. we may commingle your funds with funds of other User's and our own funds and such commingled funds could be used to pay other Users or for our general corporate purposes or otherwise, however, we will remain obliged to release or refund funds at your direction in accordance with this User Agreement.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">9.3 FEES – ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:</p>
    <p>The fee we charge for using our Services is the difference between the amount we receive from the user who buys a language service and the amount we pay to the seller who sells the language service. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, PeerOK has the discretion to set fees individually for each job, based on factors determined by PeerOK to be relevant to the circumstances. The amount we receive from the user who buys a language service is the price of the order that the user places. The amount we pay to the seller who sells the language service is determined by the word count of the language service and technical qualifications of the seller who sells the language service, as specified in Conduct of Freelancers.
